ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @Jimenoza, a Computer engineer since 2020  
ðŸŒ±Currently learning React Native, plans for the future are C#, Django, Angular and React (I know these two but I don't have a git for them xD)  
My username has nothing to do with my real name, I made it up some years ago and it's normally available haha
